# What I hope to learn in Info 201

**My main goal in Info 201 is to learn how to handle large amounts of data so that information isn't skewed.**

*This means learning to accurately:*

- gather data
- analyze data
- present data

Learning all these things will help me better understand how information is used in the world and how powerful it can be.
